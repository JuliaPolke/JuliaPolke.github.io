# What is the purpose of Area A?

<div style="width: 80%; margin: atuo; background-color: lightgrey; text-align:justify; padding:20px;">Area A of the <a href="https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat/consortium">FAIRmat Consortium</a> aims at making sample synthesis reproducible, finding hidden synthesis parameters, accelerating the development of novel materials by devising synthesis recipes, and making characterization data of synthesized materials assessable.</div>


## a bit more in detail
 Condensed-matter physics is based on the fact that materials with well-defined properties can be reproducibly realized by tailored methods. These methods are very diverse and depend on the targeted properties such as crystallinity, functionality (optoelectronic, electric, magnetic, catalytic, …), and the peculiarities of the chemistry and physics of the materials classes, covering a broad range of composition from inorganic to soft matter. Synthesis methods involve both chemistry and physics, and transformations between different phases – solid phase, melt, solution, gas phase. Their formation may be governed by thermodynamics or kinetics, and can be controlled by external stimuli like strain, electric, or magnetic fields. Physical and chemical properties as well as the functionality of synthesized materials critically depend on basic growth and synthesis parameters. Also, e.g., in the case of epitaxial growth, the source materials, details of the growth apparatus and preparation of substrates are also very critical to the outcome. Synthesis of materials follows complex workflows, involving many steps and a diversity of instru- ments, and thus many sources of data and metadata as well as various data formats.
